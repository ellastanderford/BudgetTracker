## Getting Started

Welcome to my Java Budget Tracker! It is composed of three classes that are meant to help the user track their finances.

# Class Number One -- Transaction Class
The Transaction class is composed of 5 private variables, a constructor for Transaction items, 5 get methods to access the private variables, and 5 set methods to change the values stored inside the private variables. It also has a toString() method.

# Class Number Two -- BudgetManager Class
The BudgetManager class creates an array list of transactions, and multiple banking methods. These methods are adding transactions, removing transactions, retrieving all the transactions that have occurred, retrieving the account balance, and filtering the transactions by category.

# Class Number Three -- BudgetApp Class (main)
The BudgetApp class is our main program. It uses a while loop to display the options menu to user, and take input on which function it should perform. Then using this choice, and switches/breaks, the program runs a specific block of code based on what action the user wants to be performed.
